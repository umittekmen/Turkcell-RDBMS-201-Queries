The repository is organized into the following files:

- `E_Ticaret_DB_Tables.sql`: Contains SQL scripts for creating the e-commerce database and its tables.
- `SQL_GroupBy_Examples.sql`: Includes examples using `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`.
- `Turkcell_RDBMS_Join_Queries.sql`: Demonstrates how to join multiple tables to extract meaningful relationships.
- `Turkcell_RDBMS_Subquery.sql`: Shows how to use subqueries instead of joins to solve similar problems.
